## Overview

__poppyGP Player__ is a single-page web application with a fully-responsive and platform-agnostic user interface.  In addition to mobile apps offered by popular online video streaming services, this project aims to maintain full functionality across all modern browsers, operating systems, and devices, providing users with uninterrupted access to a 24/7 video stream.

The [AngularJS][ng] JavaScript framework is instrumental as well as [Angular-Material][ng-md], the official implementation of Google's [Material design specification][md] for Angular.  Unlike the vast majority of `ngMaterial`-based front-end projects, a myriad of innovative techniques and coding alongside [Sass/Scss][sass] stylesheets provides an excellent user experience.

This repository is home to the project's "new" versions following the `v1.0.0` releases, which the author found unsatisfactory in comparison with his exceptionally high standards.
